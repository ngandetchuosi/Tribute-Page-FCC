      <p id="about-title"><strong> Who is Sinbad? </strong></p>
      <p id="tribute-info"> Sinbad is the main character of the anime <em> Magi: The Adventures of Sinbad </em>.
        The anime series follows the origins of Sinbad, who years later
        would be the King of Sindria. Originally living in the Parthevia Empire with his
        father Badr, a war veteran and his mother Esra, Sinbad loses his father due to the war
        against the Rem Empire, and spends his youth helping the local villagers and tending to his
        ill mother until he meets and shelters the mysterious Yunan, unaware that he is a Magi(Magicians that shape the
        world).
      </p>
      <p>
        By request of his mother and learning of his determination to change the world for the better,
        Yunan decides to guide Sinbad and instructs him to challenge the Dungeon "Baal" that appeared in
        the border between Partevia and Reim, and whose treasures were still unclaimed as thousands of warriors
        from both empires had challenged it, but none of them survived, except by Sinbad himself and a Parthevian
        noble whom he nicknamed "Drakon". After defeating Drakon in battle, Sinbad conquers Baal and gains the
        allegiance of the Djinn(Magical beings) residing there, thus becoming the first ever Dungeon Capturer. Sinbad
        returns
        home in time to have one last encounter with his mother at her deathbed and leaves Parthevia to start
        his own journey to change the world. </p>
